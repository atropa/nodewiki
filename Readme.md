##What it does

This is a simple wiki system that uses markdown (text) files as its
database. It reads and writes to the text files in the directory it was
started in so it is possible to use text editors to edit the files.
Version control is done through git. There is a git mode which
automatically does a git commit on each file save.

## Install

Clone this repo, navigate to it on the command line, then run:

```
npm install -g
```

*note: you may need sudo*


## Usage

    nodewiki [port]

Node Wiki can be started on any directory. To start it, simply type
`nodewiki` in the directory that you want to start it in. Without any
options, the URL for node wiki would be: http://localhost:3000/
and any other computer on the network can access the wiki (subject to
firewall settings). To specify the port either give it as the first 
argument on the command line or, set the environment varialbe `PORT`.

The command line port argument overrides the environment variable PORT 
so, you can use nodewiki even if you're already using your environment 
variable for something else!

###Examples

```
nodewiki
``` 
Starts node wiki

```
nodewiki 7777
```
Starts node wiki on port 7777

```
SET PORT 8888
nodewiki
```
Starts node wiki on port 8888
